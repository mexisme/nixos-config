# nixos-config

Top-level files correspond to the different machines. I check out this repository in my local home directory and symlink /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to these files.

NOTE THAT THIS IS MY PERSONAL CONFIG, SO WHEN ADOPTING PARTS OF IT MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IN PARTICULAR, DO NOT USE MY PUBLIC SSH KEY FOR ROOT AND USER ACCESS.
